Final Project
The Tool Box
Statement:
	Design a program in C/C++ that works as a technicianâ€™s digital tool box. With it, you will be able to have an easy to use, intuitive, and professional interface that you can use in any incoming engineering courses of your program. You may add a Magic Square generator, for fun.
Weight:
	15% of your final grade comes from this project. When handed in, it must include:
o	Custom made GUI with your name as part of the interface.
o	Complete documented code.
Due date:
	December 11th, 2015 via Blackboard.
Requirements:
Design an interface and respective code that allows the user to work with at least three engineering tools. Two of them must be chosen from this list:
-	Simple circuit analyzer (Total resistance, currents, and power dissipation; at least 3 resistors, and at least 1 Series and 1 parallel connection).
-	Magic Square Generator (functions and random).
-	Shift Register analyzer (Using functions for Flip Flops and Logic Gates).
-	Random Circuit Generator (random parallel / series circuits, with random components, and random values and calculations). *
The third tool (and more if you want) can be chosen from the previous list or built on your own. **
Restrictions, conditions, and warnings.
-	0% after 12:00am of December 12th.
-	Fair effort is expected. Complex tools are expected.
No simple calculators, date / birthday calculators, odd/even number analyzer, Decimal to binary/hex/oct, YouTube tutorials, etc.
-	Visual representation is required. Not too complicated though (it must make sense)
-	Only the cpp file should be uploaded.
*: caution: challenging program, but plausible.
**: If two programs look exactly the same (i.e. if the logic is the same, even with different interface), those projects are candidates to be equalized (Highest mark is deleted and lowest grade will be split between all the involved projects and students).
